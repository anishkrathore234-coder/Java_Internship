Approach : <br>

This project builds a simple Library Management System using Java. You create classes for library items and members, and use lists to store them. The program lets users add items, register members, borrow and return items, and see whatâ€™s available or borrowed. It saves all the data to a file when you exit, so nothing is lost. The whole system runs through a menu in the console, making it easy to use and understand. <br>

How to compile and Run : <br>
Compilation : javac Library/*.java <br>
Run : java library.LibraryApp <br>

Challenges faced : <br>
1. I faced problem while importing packages from one file to another. <br>
2. As all the files were in  one folder so while running the program we used dot. operator - it was new for me - java library.LibraryApp <br>
