Approach :<br>
The BankApp program is a simple Java-based banking application that uses object-oriented principles. It allows users to create accounts, deposit/withdraw money, check balances, and list all accounts via a menu-driven interface. Account data is persisted using file I/O, ensuring it is saved to and loaded from a file (accounts.txt) across program runs. The program is modular, user-friendly, and handles basic error-checking for file operations and account management.<br>
