Approach :
BankApp is a simple Java banking application that follows object-oriented principles. It lets users create accounts, deposit or withdraw money, check account balances, and see a list of all accounts using an easy menu. The account data is saved in a file (accounts.txt) so it can be loaded again when the program is run next time. The program is easy to use, organized, and checks for basic errors when handling files or managing accounts.

How to compile and Run a program :
In command prompt, go to the location of the .java files present.
For Compiling : javac BankApp.java
For running the program : java BankApp
